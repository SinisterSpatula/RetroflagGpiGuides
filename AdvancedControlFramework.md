# Advanced Controller Framework

 ### **IMPORTANT please do not update other than Controls_Menu_Update.  If you choose to get system updates things may break and it is strongly recommended that you make a backup first, should you choose to do any major updates.**

The Super Retropie GPi image has additional software and drivers installed which allow the GPi
controls to be remapped to virtually any standalone emulator. This not only allows full
button/dpad compatibility but also allows for hotkeys and even additional buttons that aren’t
present in the GPi case (such as L2 and R2). Wherever possible, the hotkeys have been mapped
to mimic Libretro controls, i.e. select+start to exit, select+R to save state, etc.
You will find a script installed in the Retropie section of Emulation Station, called
control_updater_menu, which will allow you to download updates to the control scheme. This
way, rather than downloading a new GPi image or installing the software yourself, you can
download new controller setups or even support for additional emulators.

The script has the following menu items:

Update Controls is the option most users will want, while Update Controls Beta is for testers
ONLY and is highly discouraged from use.
IF YOUR D-PAD STOPS WORKING: The Gpi has a hidden option to change the D-PAD mode. To
switch to hat mode (default) press SELECT+DPAD UP for 5 seconds. To switch to joystick/axis
mode, press SELECT+DPAD LEFT for 5 seconds. You will know it worked when the LED flashes.
The controls in our image are set for the d-pad “hat” mode, so if you find that the d-pad is not
working, try switching back to this mode as instructed above. If you switch to joystick mode you
will have to remap your controls (not advised).
